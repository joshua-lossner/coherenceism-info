# About Coherenceism

Coherenceism is a lens for viewing reality as an interconnected field where truth emerges from resonance, not dominance. Systems align when their parts reduce distortion for the whole.

## Core Insight

Like a singing bowl that sustains its tone through steady presence, coherence emerges not from force but from consistent attention. When we align with patterns rather than imposing them, reality carries the work forward.

## This Site

This website renders content from the [CORA repository](https://github.com/joshua-lossner/cora) - a Coherent Operating & Reasoning Architecture that stores intent as structured entities in plain Markdown files.

The content here includes:
- **Roots** - Foundation and anchors of the coherentist lens
- **Branches** - Major themes and areas of exploration

## Living Lens

Coherenceism is not a fixed doctrine but a living lens. It evolves through:
- Testing perspectives against reality
- Composting failures into learning
- Building on what resonates
- Releasing what creates noise

## Get Involved

Explore the roots, browse the branches, and if something resonates, consider how this lens might apply in your own context. Coherence grows through practice, not belief.
