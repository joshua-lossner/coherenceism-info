# About Coherenceism

Coherenceism is a philosophy that views reality as an interconnected field where truth emerges from resonance, not dominance. Systems align when their parts reduce distortion for the whole.

## Core Insight

Like a singing bowl that sustains its tone through steady presence, coherence emerges not from force but from consistent attention. When we align with patterns rather than imposing them, reality carries the work forward.

## This Site

This website renders content from the [CORA repository](https://github.com/yourusername/cora) - a Coherent Operating & Reasoning Architecture that stores intent as structured entities in plain Markdown files.

The content here includes:
- **Philosophy** - Core principles and practices
- **Essays** - Deep explorations of coherentist perspectives
- **Knowledge Tree** - Living structure of interconnected concepts

## Living Philosophy

Coherenceism is not a fixed doctrine but a living practice. It evolves through:
- Testing ideas against reality
- Composting failures into learning
- Building on what resonates
- Releasing what creates noise

## Get Involved

Explore the philosophy, read the essays, and if something resonates, consider how these principles might apply in your own context. Coherence grows through practice, not belief.
